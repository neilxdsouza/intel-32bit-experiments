This project is a list of my tinkering with the 32 bit i386 and above CPUs
Each program is simple and builds on the previous one incrementally


make_floppy.c: this file creates a floppy disk sized image. We will write our
binary programs to this floppy and use an emulator to see the result.

Emulators: bochs has excellent debugging support:
The lines below marked by ---- are from the bochs manual. Refer to the chapter
"Using the Bochs internal debugger"
------------------
To use the debugger, you must configure Bochs with the --enable-debugger and --enable-disasm flags. For example:
  ./configure --enable-debugger --enable-disasm
------------------
You can also use qemu.

I run bochs this way:
/usr/bochs2.3/bin/bochs -q 'boot:a' 'floppya: 1_44=floppy.img, status=inserted'
